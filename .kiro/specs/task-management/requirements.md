# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Task Management System that will be integrated into the existing React application. The system will allow users to create, organize, and track tasks with features like categorization, priority levels, due dates, and progress tracking. This feature will complement the existing utility applications by providing users with a comprehensive task organization tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage tasks, so that I can organize my work and personal activities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Create Task" button THEN the system SHALL display a task creation form
2. WHEN a user fills out the task form with title, description, and category THEN the system SHALL validate the required fields
3. WHEN a user submits a valid task form THEN the system SHALL save the task and display a success message
4. WHEN a user views the task list THEN the system SHALL display all tasks with their basic information
5. IF a user tries to create a task without a title THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to categorize and prioritize my tasks, so that I can focus on what's most important.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a task THEN the system SHALL provide predefined categories (Work, Personal, Shopping, Health, etc.)
2. WHEN creating or editing a task THEN the system SHALL provide priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
3. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by category and priority
4. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish tasks by priority level
5. WHEN a user selects a category filter THEN the system SHALL display only tasks from that category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set due dates and track task completion, so that I can meet deadlines and monitor my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a task THEN the system SHALL allow setting an optional due date
2. WHEN a task has a due date THEN the system SHALL display the due date prominently
3. WHEN a task is overdue THEN the system SHALL highlight it with a warning indicator
4. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the task status and move it to completed section
5. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL show completion statistics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit and delete tasks, so that I can keep my task list current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a task THEN the system SHALL display task details with edit options
2. WHEN a user modifies task information THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes
3. WHEN a user clicks delete on a task THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation
4. WHEN a user confirms task deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the task permanently
5. IF a user tries to edit a completed task THEN the system SHALL allow editing but maintain completion status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and sort my tasks, so that I can quickly find specific tasks or organize them by different criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter tasks by title and description in real-time
2. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL provide sorting options (due date, priority, creation date, alphabetical)
3. WHEN a user selects a sort option THEN the system SHALL reorder the task list accordingly
4. WHEN no tasks match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "no tasks found" message
5. WHEN the search box is cleared THEN the system SHALL display all tasks again

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tasks to persist between sessions, so that I don't lose my task data when I close and reopen the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates, edits, or deletes a task THEN the system SHALL save the changes to local storage
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page or reopens the application THEN the system SHALL load all previously saved tasks
3. WHEN the local storage is corrupted or unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and start with an empty task list
4. WHEN a user has no saved tasks THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message with instructions
5. IF local storage is full THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent new task creation until space is available
